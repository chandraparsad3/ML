1. Customer Churn Prediction
Problem: Predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using a company's service) based on their usage patterns and demographic information.
Algorithms:
Logistic Regression: For its simplicity and interpretability.
Random Forest: For handling complex interactions and providing feature importance.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): For high predictive accuracy.
Data: Customer demographics, usage statistics, service interactions, and historical churn data.

2. Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews
Problem: Classify the sentiment of customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral to understand customer satisfaction.
Algorithms:
Naive Bayes: Effective for text classification with a probabilistic approach.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Good for high-dimensional data like text features.
Transformers (e.g., BERT): For state-of-the-art performance in understanding context and nuance in text.
Data: Product reviews, ratings, and possibly additional metadata (like review length or reviewer details).

3. Predicting House Prices
Problem: Estimate the market price of a house based on its features like location, size, number of bedrooms, and other attributes.
Algorithms:
Linear Regression: For its simplicity and interpretability in understanding relationships between features and price.
Decision Trees: To capture non-linear relationships and interactions.
Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost): For high predictive accuracy and handling complex data patterns.
Data: House features (square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, age of the property, etc.) and historical sale prices.

Each of these projects provides a good introduction to different aspects of supervised learning and uses different algorithms to address unique challenges in data analysis.
